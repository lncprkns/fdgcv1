            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                The Freeport Disc Golf Club is a group of people that love disc golf and enjoy getting together on a regular basis to compete against each other in weekly league events.
                In addition to competing against each other, the club works together, along with the Freeport Park District and Highland Community College, to improve the quality and safety
                of the two courses in Freeport. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The league events are a fun way to meet new people in the area while playing a competitive round of disc golf that still feels relaxed compared
                to a highly competitive tournament round.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What are the weekly league events?</h2>
            <p>
                Starting in April or May (weather dependent) the club will announce its schedule for its disc golf season, which runs until late September or early October. These events
                are called bag tag rounds. At your first bag tag round of the year, you will need to purchase a bag tag, a small piece of plastic or metal that has a number on it which
                represents your current ranking in the league. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each weekly round, the group looks at the scores for everyone that played that night and bag tags are traded
                based on score. If you start the night with tag number 11 and shoot the best score of the night then you would trade your tag number 11 in for the lowest number tag
                that competed that evening. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The bag tag league round is usually Wednesday evenings at 5:30pm with a rotating schedule of 1 week at Krape Park followed by 1 week at the
                course at Highland Community College. This schedule can change based on weather or course conditions, and schedule changes are always announced on the club Facebook page.
            </p>
